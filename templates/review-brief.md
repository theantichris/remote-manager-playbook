# Review Brief

If you need me to review something here is a helpful 3 part template.

1. List of items to be reviewed with links or attachments.

- Make sure I have access to the documents.

1. Deadline and desire feedback format (Slack, Notion, etc.).
1. Decisions or feedback needed (the feedback needed and not the feedback I want to give).
