# Remote Management Playbook

## üëã Hey, y'all

When working with a remote, distributed, asynchronous team it is important to be handbook first. Everything a team member needs to know should be easily discoverable and consumed.

I think it is, also, important that you have transparency with your team. Let them know how you operate and what to expect. Communicate to them what you value and how you approach things. No one should ever have to guess at what you're thinking or what they should do.

## ü•ñ My role

I am not here to make sure you do your job, I am here to make sure you can do your job.

My role is to lead people, teams, and organizations to achieve their goals and grow. I want my people to thrive in their whole life, not just at work. I want you to feel happy, healthy, fulfilled, productive, and accomplished. I want you to feel that you are excelling at your job and have all the knowledge you need to be effective and self-sufficient. I am here to support you through all of this.

## üíé What do I value most?

### What does helping me look like?

### What is my process for handling conflicts (and how can you do it yourself)?

### What weaknesses of mine should the team know about and how can they help me improve?

## ‚úÖ My Expectations

[DELETE LATER] Try to answer these questions: How should people set time with you? When it comes to mistakes, what's the best way for employees to come forward? How do you define "Done"? When should people be available and how? (e.g. work hours, availability via chat/phone etc.)

## üó£Ô∏è 1:1s

[DELETE LATER]  Try to answer these questions: When do you usually have 1:1s with your team? Who should lead the 1:1 (you or them)? What should be the main focus during that time?

## üòà Personality quirks

[DELETE LATER]  Try to answer this question: What are the individual quirks that anyone working with me should know about? Usually, these quirks are not "good" or "bad", they just part of who you are. It's the small things that people do that gets you extremely happy/excited or extremely upset/nervous within 5 seconds without any good reason.

## üóìÔ∏è Where to focus on your first 90 days?

[DELETE LATER]  Try to answer these questions: What does effective onboarding look like on your team? How can they tell if they're doing a good job in their first 30 days?
