# Remote Management Playbook

## üëã Hey, y'all

Working with a remote, distributed, asynchronous team necessitates a handbook-first approach. All information that a team member needs should be easily discoverable and consumable.

Transparency is key. I want to ensure my team understands how I work and what is expected. We should all communicate ours values and approach clearly to eliminate any guesswork about my thoughts or what they should be doing.

## ü•ñ My role

I am not here to make sure you do your job, I am here to make sure you can do your job.

My role is to guide people, teams, and organizations towards achieving their goals and fostering growth. I want my team to excel in their lives, not just at work. I aim for you to feel happy, healthy, fulfilled, productive, and accomplished. I strive for you to feel that you are proficient in your job and possess the knowledge required to be effective and self-sufficient. I am here to support you in all of this.

## üíé What do I value most

* Holistic development. We are not just employees, we're people. We are not just employees, we're people. Our work life influences our personal life and vice versa. Strive for a healthy work-life balance. Let your successes in one fuel the other.
* Growth.
* Results.
* Focus. Limit your work in progress (WIP) and prioritize what is important. Prioritizing tasks and limiting multitasking leads to better results.

## üèóÔ∏è How I operate

* My typical work hours are Monday - Friday, 7am - 4pm Eastern. I am usually unavailable outside these hours, with work notifications turned off.
* Organization is crucial for me. I rely heavily on my calendar and notebooks.

## ‚úÖ My Expectations

* Keep your word. If something comes up that makes this impossible, let me know. Shit happens, let's figure it out together.
* Be honest and transparent.
* Continuously learn and grow.
* Maintain a healthy balance between work and personal life. Prioritize your mental health and what is significant to you.

## üòà Personality quirks

* I am quite forgetful. If I do not note something down, there's a good chance I'll forget it.
* I have narcolepsy. If you see me yawn, I'm not bored, just tired. If you see me get up and move around, it's to maintain my attention and wakefulness.
