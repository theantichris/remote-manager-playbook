# Remote Management Playbook

## üëã Hey, y'all

When working with a remote, distributed, asynchronous team it is important to be handbook first. Everything a team member needs to know should be easily discoverable and consumed.

I think it is, also, important that you have transparency with your team. Let them know how you operate and what to expect. Communicate to them what you value and how you approach things. No one should ever have to guess at what you're thinking or what they should do.

## ü•ñ My role

I am not here to make sure you do your job, I am here to make sure you can do your job.

My role is to lead people, teams, and organizations to achieve their goals and grow. I want my people to thrive in their whole life, not just at work. I want you to feel happy, healthy, fulfilled, productive, and accomplished. I want you to feel that you are excelling at your job and have all the knowledge you need to be effective and self-sufficient. I am here to support you through all of this.

## üíé What do I value most

* The whole person. We are not just employees, we're people. How we feel in our work life influences how we feel in our personal life and visa versa. Maintain a healthy balance between work and life. Let your successes in one fuel the other.
* Growth.
* Results.
* Focus. Limit your work in progress (WIP) and focus on what is important.. Prioritizing what you need to do at any given time and limiting how many things you do at once leads to better results.

## üèóÔ∏è How I operate

* I typically work Monday - Friday, 7am - 4pm Eastern. I am normally unavailable outside of those hours and have work notifications turned off.
* I am a very organized person.
* I am extremely forgetful. If I do not write something down there is a good chance I will forget about it.

## ‚úÖ My Expectations

* Do what you say.
* Be honest and transparent.
* Learn and grow.
* Maintain a healthy balance between work and life. Take care of your mental health.

## üòà Personality quirks

[DELETE LATER]  Try to answer this question: What are the individual quirks that anyone working with me should know about? Usually, these quirks are not "good" or "bad", they just part of who you are. It's the small things that people do that gets you extremely happy/excited or extremely upset/nervous within 5 seconds without any good reason.
