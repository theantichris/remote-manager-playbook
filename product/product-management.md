# Product management

## Problem discovery

* Explore the different problems that you could solve.
* What are the users' pain points?
* What are the users' trying to accomplish?
* How does your app compare to competitors?
* What kind of hidden users does your app have that you aren't serving?
* What current strengths does your app have you could use to your advantage?
* What are you able to do that your competitors can't?
* What could you build today that would compound your advantage over time?

## Problem selection

* Narrow down your problems to a specific list.
* What do you need to do to survive your current reality?
* Where do you need to be for the next phase of reality?
* What would ensure you're trending to a winning phase of reality?
* Where do you think the industry is moving and how can you take advantage of that now?
* What is the return on investment?
* What are your quick wins?
* What could you experiment with and learn now that would make the future easier?

## Solution validation

* Take the risk out of your approach.
* Write the launch announcement you'd send after shipping. Is it exciting, useful, and realistic?
* How has this problem been solved before?
* Identify test users. If you can't it might not be worth building.
* Experiment over analyze. There is almost always missing information.
* Find the cheapest way to validate.
* Justify the cost the users pay for adoption.
