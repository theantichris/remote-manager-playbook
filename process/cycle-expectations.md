# Cycle Expectations

1. Starting cycle
1. Communication
1. Progress

## Principals

1. Don't extend cycle.
1. Don't extend cool-down.
1. The work should feel comfortable.

## Phases and checkpoints

1. Problem framing meeting
   * Attendants: Product group (product manager, engineering manager, designer, tech lead, QA engineer)
   * Purpose: Problem identification and framing for future work
   * Outcome: Roadmap, pitches with framed problems
1. Basecamp project creation
   * Created by the engineering manager so the team can add tasks and scopes as they shape
1. Cycle tracker creation
   * Created by the engineering manager and updated by the tech lead
1. Pitch handoff meeting
   * Attendants: Entire team
   * Purpose: The product group presents the pitch with framed problem to the build team
   * Outcome: The build team is aligned with the product group on the problem we are solving, its constraints and contexts
1. Shaping
   * Attendants: Build team (designer, software engineers, QA engineer), owned and led by designer and tech lead
   * Purpose: Shaping a solution to solve the framed problem, vetting the solution (shaping checklist)
   * Outcome: A shaped solution on the pitch to solve the framed problem
1. Solution alignment meeting
   * Attendants: Entire team
   * Purpose: To present and align on the shaped, solution
   * Outcome: Product manager approval on the solution to solve the framed problem
1. Scope review meeting
   * Attendants: Entire team
   * Purpose: Review the Basecamp project as a final check that the team is ready for cycle
   * Outcome: Finalize tasks and scopes in Basecamp, confidence that the team is ready to start work and it fits into the appetite
1. In-cycle progress update
   * Owned: Build team
   * Purpose: Mid-cycle the build team should post updates to the #product-progress channel in Slack
1. Project summary
   * Owned: Tech lead, engineering manager
   * Purpose: Communicate up how the cycle went and ended
1. Retrospective meeting
   * Attendants: Entire team
   * Purpose: Reflect and discuss learnings from the cycle
   * Outcome: Actions items for the team to pursue towards team improvement
1. Team radar
   * Owned: Engineering manager
   * Purpose: Gauge how the team feels about their work and environment
   * Outcome: Engineering manager knows where to spend their time and effort
