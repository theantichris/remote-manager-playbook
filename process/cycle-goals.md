# ðŸŽ¯ Cycle goals

## Purpose

The cycle goal communicates to the team what we are trying to accomplish at the end of a cycle.

It shouldn't be just "implement this solution in this time frame" but something we can say is true after we are finished. More often than not, it should be user focused.

The problem statement, appetite, and goal of a pitch are what the team will use to shape a solution. These 3 items needed to be set before the team can shape an effective solution.

## Example goals

* Allow users to easily add documents they commonly use on projects from a project or in a project template.
* Users are able to restrict access of documents to the uploader, admin, and manager for existing documents.
* Out internal teams will be able to resume building on Slab and will be able to contribute to mobile, web, and token packages.
