# Sizing

Think about the size of your work like a good pair of pants. Both need to feel comfortable.

If you put too little food on your plate your pants will be too loose. You end up with a lot of extra room and they'll fall down, embarrassing you.

If you put too much food on your plate your pants will get too tight. They will feel constricting and you won't have room to be flexible.

When planning your work divide your food into meals and cake. You need to finish your meal in order to get to the cake but if you eat too much you won't have room for cake.

## Practical Guidance

- Preferred size: tickets that fit in 2â€“3 days of focused work.
- WIP: limit concurrent work; finish more by starting less.
- Split by outcome: if it won't fit, slice by user-visible outcomes.
- Acceptance criteria: write what "done" looks like in plain language.
- Definition of done: code merged, tests passing, feature toggled, docs updated.
- Anti-patterns: mega-epics with vague outcomes, serial blockers, no owner.
