# Strategy and Vision

Strategies are documents which explain trade-offs and actions that will be taken for challenges.

Visions are documents that enable people who don't work closely together to make decisions that fit together.

## Strategies

A strategy should recommend specific actions that address the challenges, constraints, and context. "Good Strategy/Bad Strategy" by Richard Rumelt recommends that they have three sections:

- Diagnosis
- Policies
- Actions

### Diagnosis

The diagnosis is a theory describing the challenge. It details the context and constraints that define the problem. It should be a thorough problem statement.

### Policies

Policies are the approach you'll take to solve the problem. They should include what trade-offs you'll be making.

### Actions

These are what you get when you apply your policies to the diagnosis.

## Vision

A vision describes a future in which the tradeoffs from strategy are no longer mutually exclusive.

### Vision statement

A 1 or 2 sentence aspirational statement to summarize the rest of the vision. This is the core statement that should be repeated at each meeting, planning session, and review.

### Value proposition

How will you be valuable to your users and the company? What success will you enable them to achieve?

### Out of scope

What is explicitly not included.

### Risks

What could go wrong, and how you'll mitigate or monitor it.

### Anti-goals

Clear statements about outcomes you are not pursuing to avoid distractions.

### Narrative

A short narrative that combines all the information and details into something that is easy to digest and understand.

### Capabilities

What capabilities will you need in order to deliver the value proposition?

### Solved constraints

What constraints do you have today that the vision solves?

### Future constraints

What constraints do you expect to encounter in the future?
