# Strategy and visions

Strategies are documents which explain trade-offs and action that will be take for challenges.

Visions are documents that enable people who don't work closely together to make decisions that fit together.

## Strategies

A strategy should recommend specific actions that address the challenges constraints and context. "Good Strategy/Bad Strategy" by Richard Rumelt recommends that they have three sections:

* Diagnosis
* Policies
* Actions

### Diagnosis

The diagnosis is a theory describing the challenge. It details the context and constraints that define the problem. It should be a thorough problem statement.

### Policies

Policies are the approach you'll take to solve the problem. They should include what trade-offs you'll be making.

### Actions

These are what you get when you apply your policies to the diagnosis.
