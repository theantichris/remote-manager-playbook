# Goals

"Bad goals are indistinguishable from numbers." - Will Larson

Good goals are made up of 4 specific kinds of numbers:

1. A target - where you want to go
1. A baseline - where you are now
1. A trend - your current velocity
1. A time frame - the bounds for the change

The tests for a good goal are:

1. Someone that doesn't know the details of the project can tell its difficulty.
1. Someone that doesn't know the details of the project can determine if it was successful.

## Investments and baselines

An investment describes where you want to be in the future, a baseline describes what you have now that you want to keep.

It is often a great idea to pair investments with baselines in your goals to help narrow the scope you use to find a solution. Baselines can also be useful in identifying when you should pause on going after a goal and instead invest in platform quality.

## Example goal

- Baseline: 88% weekly success rate on checkout.
- Trend: -1.2% per month over the last quarter.
- Target: 95% weekly success rate.
- Time frame: by end of Q2.
