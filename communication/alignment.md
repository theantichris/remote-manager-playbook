# Alignment

## Controls

These are the mechanisms that I use to align with my people.

### Metrics

Outcomes while being flexible around how they are acheived.

### Visions

Long-term direction with short-term flexibility.

### Strategies

Shared understanding of our current constraints and how we'll address them.

### Organization design

Coordination around the development of the wider organization within the context of subgroups.

### Head count and transfers

How orginizational priorities align across teams.

### Roadmaps

Problem selection and solution validation.

### Performance reviews

Culture and recognition.

## Degress of alignment

For each control we'll have a degree of alignment based on the context and relationship.

### I'll do this

Stuff I will be responsible for doing myself.

### Preview

Stuff I want to be involved with early and often to help be on the same page and redoing work.

### Review

Stuff that we are well aligned on and I want to see and provide feedback on before it is shared with a larger audience.

### Notes

Stuff I want to follow but don't have a lot to add to myself. This allows me to better represent your work.

### No surprises

Stuff we are currently aligned on but requires updates to keep me in the loop.

### Let me know

Stuff we are well aligned on and to let me know if anything comes up that I can help with.
