# 1:1s

I prefer to schedule 1:1s weekly, generally lasting 30 minutes. We can extend them if necessary, and it's okay if we don't use all the allocated time. This is a weekly time slot I reserve specifically for you to discuss any topics you need or wish to cover. I avoid skipping 1:1s unless one of us is on vacation. If a conflict arises and you can't attend, let me know so we can reschedule or conduct the meeting asynchronously.

We will maintain a shared agenda for our 1:1s, which will contain our planned discussion points and any notes we take. I encourage you to contribute your own topics for discussion and jot down any necessary notes.

During our 1:1, I expect you to drive the conversation. Don't hesitate to bring up anything that's on your mind. This meeting isn't just a report of your activities, but a platform for you to present your ideas, challenges, and issues that you wish to discuss.
