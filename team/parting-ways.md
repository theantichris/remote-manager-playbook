# Parting Ways

Remember, firing someone isn't nearly as unpleasant as being fired. It is important to remove all the pain and uncertainty you can from this process. Make it about them, how they feel. It is your job to deliver the news with sensitivity, compassion, and respect.

1. Doing this over video is the best option. The person needs to see your face, body language, and sincerity in helping them move on in a positive way.
1. Don't wait until Friday or some other significant date. Do it the morning after you decide to. Avoid scheduling too far in advance to reduce anxiety.
1. Include someone from People Ops/HR. They can help buffer and cover details. It is also good to have a witness present.
1. Don't beat around the bush or make small talk. Make it clear what is happening from the beginning.
1. Try to cover everything before giving them a chance to speak. Outline the steps and what is required before paying severance.
1. Stick around to answer questions. Only get into reasons if they ask. Let them end the conversation.
1. Have someone else remove their logins during your meeting. Have their email forwarded.
1. Communicate with the company and team after the meeting has concluded. Have this drafted and ready.
1. Schedule an exit interview for another day.

## Script (short)

- "I have difficult news. Today is your last day at **Company**. This decision is final. I want to walk you through logistics and answer questions. HR is here to support next steps, including severance and benefits. I'm grateful for your contributions and I'll support you however I can through the transition."

Note: HR and legal requirements vary by region; coordinate before scheduling.
