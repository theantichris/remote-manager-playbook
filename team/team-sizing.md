# Team Sizing

* Teams should be six to eight during stead state.
  * This gives the manager enough time for active coaching, coordinating, and furthering the team's mission.
  * Smaller teams can fail to come together and act more like the individuals.
  * On small teams the manager functions more like a tech lead and does not have time to improve their managerial skills.
  * Supporting more than eight people keeps them too busy to actively invest in the team and they typically act more like a coach.
* To create a new team, grow an existing team to eight to ten and then split into two teams.
* Keep innovation and maintenance together.
  * Splitting this between different teams can have a negative impact on moral and ownership.
