# Team Sizing

- Teams should be six to eight during steady state.
  - This gives the manager enough time for active coaching, coordinating, and furthering the team's mission.
  - Smaller teams can fail to come together and act more like individuals.
  - On small teams the manager functions more like a tech lead and does not have time to improve their managerial skills.
  - Supporting more than eight people keeps them too busy to actively invest in the team and they typically act more like a coach.
- To create a new team, grow an existing team to eight to ten and then split into two teams.
- Keep innovation and maintenance together.
  - Splitting this between different teams can have a negative impact on morale and ownership.

## Exceptions

- Incubation teams or spikes may be smaller for speed and learning.
- Temporary cross-team strike forces can flex larger; add a clear end date.

## Composition

- Include the skills needed to ship and maintain (product, design, QA, platform, on-call).
- Keep innovation and maintenance together to preserve ownership and context.
